      <br>There are two studies conducted in this paper: (1) one investigation into using supervised learning to create engaging social media messages about space science and (2) one on examining if features of supervised learning are exclusive to space science. This work explores the creation of engaging and effective social media posts for science communication to the general public.

      <br>This paper discusses science communication and its importance to the general public. The research group in this paper has developed a social media communication initiative (@oceanseaicenpi), sharing their research with the general public. They hope to bring awareness to climate change and ways to develop a more sustainable future. In this paper, the group discusses their target audience, the posts they use and the benefits of this approach to science communication.

      <br>This paper discusses the impacts of the Internet on science communication between scholars in the context of cancer research. A distinction is made between the formal (e.g., articles in peer-reviewed journals, conferences) and informal (e.g., talking to collaborators, sharing drafts of papers), but the paper argues that the Internet has begun to blur the lines between the two; although it is good that the public has access to quality information, it is also important to be able to determine data trustworthiness online. In terms of communication to the public, the paper describes how blogging in particular is a powerful method of informal communication that can reach a very large audience. Blogs can be used to talk directly to the public, and by focusing on one's own area of research, they can cover material with far more depth than can many other methods. They can also be used to talk to other scientists in a public forum, where many people can get involved and see the discussions that are going on.

      <br>This paper explores how various audiences, both academic and non-academic, access, trust, and communicate science. The paper talks about how there is a scale on which science communication occurs. On one hand, there are peer-reviewed journals, which are highly trustworthy to all audiences, but may only reach a small audience. On the other hand, other outlets like social media or television can reach a much larger audience, but they are not useful if they are not deemed to be trustworthy. The paper then discusses some potential solutions: for example, a leading scientist might create a verified social media account to establish trust. The paper suggests citizen science as another way to increase engagement with science; it may be a good way of informing the public and increasing their appreciation for the scientific process. Interestingly, the paper finds that the public reports that there is little communication with other groups (e.g., academics), highlighting the need for effective public outreach efforts.

      <br>This media studies paper documents various memetic communication strategies used on TikTok, including the use of familiar meme audios. It also categorizes non-memetic science communication strategies, including demonstrations, explanations to an audience, so-called “plain speaking” lecture-based methods, and so on. The authors also note that some of the most popular science communication videos on the platform do not rely on extensive discussion of scientific phenomena, but rather incorporate them as part of a broader narrative (“affective science”), an appealing visual (“aesthetic science”), or in the presentation of a novel or surprising factoid (“nerdy is the new trendy”).

      <br>The paper explores the scholarly impact of a scientific paper based on how the scientific community and public respond to social media mentions on the platform ‘Twitter’, downloads on the online database ‘arXiv.org’, and article citations. The research also implicates a strong statistical and even casual correlation between twitter mentions and the number of downloads from the database, suggesting the benefits of using the social media platform to encourage higher readership as well as early citations. The importance of the use of social media beyond traditional notions as a means of affecting citation behavior and public engagement are emphasized through this paper.

      <br>The paper discusses how the social media platform ‘Twitter’ is used in physics conferences and claims that the use of Twitter is more prominent in discussions around the topics of elementary particles and fields, geophysics, astronomy and astrophysics. It was mentioned that the virtual network online obtained by partaking in social media may be much larger than a network garnered by traditional means, which highly incentivizes current scientists to use social media. The paper also highlighted the deliberate degeneracy in use of hashtags to organize ‘tweets’ together and minimize the chances of the public from seeing irrelevant information. Tweets posted during the conference were mainly original, linked (directing to a link outside of twitter) or a conversation (mentioning another twitter user). Benefits and limitations of ‘tweets’ were also discussed in the paper.

      <br>This book discusses the structure of the universe based off the inflationary theory and how that led to the creation of matter. By learning about the beginning stages of stars, and their ability to create heavier elements. We can predict their life cycles and explain to our audience what stage our sun is at and where it is heading.

      Smolin, Lee. Time Reborn: From the Crisis in Physics to the Future of the Universe. Penguin, 2013. 
      <br>This novel helps develop further understanding of the evolution of universal laws. Creating a stronger understanding for Cosmology and the reasons behind star cycles. It also explains the battle between relativity and the quantum world, as the mathematical principles don’t share a one to one correlation. This knowledge will be used in our star cycle, and ant man posts.

      Williams, Matt. “What is the Life Cycle of the Sun?” Universe Today. Accessed March 03 2022. https://spaceandbeyondbox.com/life-cycle-of-the-sun/
      <br>A star begins its life as a giant cloud of molecular gas and dust. As the gas cloud becomes more and more massive, it also becomes denser, and its gravitational pull becomes stronger. Thus it attracts even more gas and dust, and the increased pressure leads to the gas cloud heating up. This continues for a few hundred thousand more years before temperatures and pressures are sufficiently high that the ball of gas ignites and fusion begins inside the star. From here, the star burns hydrogen in its core for most of the remainder of its life (main sequence). When its hydrogen fuel has been depleted, it moves on to burning helium (giant) in a shell around the core. Afterward, the star begins burning helium in its core and thermally pulsates for another few hundred thousand years before exploding and throwing off massive amounts of material. This marks the end of the fusion in the star, and for the rest of its life the star fades to black as a white dwarf.

      <br>Understanding the quantum realm and how the laws of nature change based on your size will help us grasp Ant-Man’s experience. This popular science book takes the approach of string theory to explain the forces of the universe. Focusing on the Planck scale, we can say knots, links, and kinks weave strings in different shapes which express many frequencies that form the fields of matter.

      <br>This short passage from the scientific consultant behind the Ant-Man films outlines how the “quantum realm” concept came to be. Michalakis was not required to provide a rigorous scientific explanation for the script, although he does outline what he would have suggested: that the fictional technology convert Scott Lang’s electrons into muons (preserving chemical composition while lowering mass) with an energy of 20 TeV (relativistically extending the half-life of muons to a few seconds).

      <br>In this short paper, Dave Crewe presents a number of ways educators can use the Ant-Man films to spark curiosity about physics in the classroom. Crewe summarizes some of the scientific elements of the films from biology and physics. He provides abstract suggestions for the quantum physics educators can explore with their students, including Heiseingerg’s uncertainty principle and quantum tunneling, although he does not provide a concrete way to make these topics accessible to a lay audience.

      <br>This paper summarizes the relevant electromagnetism and quantum mechanics behind the intuitive concept of touch. It highlights how atomic electron clouds never make direct particle-particle contact, although their wave packets can overlap. It concludes by explaining how scanning tunneling microscopes exploit this phenomena to probe surfaces at the atomic level.

      <br>This short article from Futurism describes how the Pauli exclusion principle prevents electron clouds from truly ‘overlapping’ in the intuitive sense. However, it does a poor job of explaining the principle to a lay audience, relying on a quotation from another source. For our purposes, this serves as a useful example of poor science communication that we can contrast our own posts against.
