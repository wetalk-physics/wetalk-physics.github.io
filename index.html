      <br><p>
    From industry to research, a big aspect of a career in science is being able to effectively communicate topics and ideas relevant to your field. 
    Our project analyzes the different ways scientific topics, specifically physical science related themes, can be communicated via social media and blog platforms. 
    Using three main topics and five media platforms, we aim to address some key questions in this field: 
    What is the most effective way of communicating science in the age of technology? 
    How do different social media platforms compare in terms of public engagement? 
    What physics topics (of the three selected) get the most/least interest and on which platform? 
    What factors contributed to increased/lessened interaction (e.g. clickbait, relation to well known media, jargon, etc.)? 
<br>
    Though efficacy of science communication is commonly reassessed with ever changing media platforms, there has been a boom in this field since the start of the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic; but this has mainly been in the field of publicizing public health and biology. 
    Addressing how communication varies between different fields of science (i.e. public health vs. physical sciences) is the next step in assessing the overall efficacy of science communication and that is what we aim to do in this project. 
    Through our work, we aim to address the relationship between physics and society during this age of technology by investigating the way information is communicated in our different media platforms. 
    Further, we hope to assess how the public engagement in science in the media has changed from before the COVID-19 pandemic to during and after, as well as comparing viewpoints from Canada and North America to those outside. 
    We will use our results from this project in conjunction with various papers on science communication in both physics and other domains, from a broad range of years and countries, to assess how the public engages with science through non-conventional educational platforms. 
<br>
    Our group is composted of five group members, each of which was assigned to one of the following media platform: Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Tumblr, and Medium. 
    On said platforms, we present our three topics – Lifecycle of the Sun, Science behind Ant-Man’s Quantum Realm, Why Things Never Really Touch – using different approaches and techniques to engage the target audiences. 
    Due to the nature of the different platforms, the delivery (e.g. post length and detail) varies between the posts; this is another factor in comparing and contrasting the different ways science is communicated in the media. 
    For consistency, one brief and engaging post for each topic is published weekly at 12:00 PM EST on all platforms, between March 11 and 25, 2022. 
    The engagement of each post is monitored daily at 9:00 PM EST during the first week after each post is published; this engagement is tracked via likes, comments, shares and reposts, where applicable.

      <br><p>
      We are a group of five university physics students conducting a study on science communication on various social media platforms. 
        Using topics we are familiar with, we aim to compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks to presenting science on different platforms and at different levels. 
        From this work, we hope to enhance our own understanding of complex physics topics by explaining them concisely and compellingly, further developing our science communication, an asset in continuing in a science-based career.
<br>
        Our goals for this work are to engourage intentional engagement in physics by the general public through our posts, 
        to highlight the relationships both individual people and society have with physics 
        and use the different platforms to empathize with this wide range of relationships.
        We hope to apply existing physics education research findings on communication practices in practical contexts, such as in our posts.
